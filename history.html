						The history of martial arts in Korea has about two thousand years,
						its count from the era of three states (1-7th century), when on the
						territory of the Korean peninsula were three kingdoms - <strong> Kogurye, Pekche
						and Silla.</strong>  Each of them had its own combat training systems.
						In the state of Kogurya was a system of martial arts called "sanba".
						In the kingdom of Pecce was “subak" and the elements of this system have
						survived to our days in the form of subakdo. The school's technique combines
						sharp attacks and soft defenses.
						In 540, Sin Hun became king of Silla, and he was connected all 3 states
						together. He creates a new style of fight called “Hvaran”.<br>


						In the <strong>17th and 19th</strong> centuries, Korea's martial arts did not develop much.
						In 1910, Korea became an integral part of Japan, which influenced all spheres
						of its development-martial arts also did not stand aside. One of the pupils of
						the Daito ryu school, Aiki-Jutsu Tokeda Sokaku, since 1919, was a Korean, Choe
						Yong Sol. Having lived in Japan for 27 years, he connected the aiki-jutsu technique
						with the traditional tekken and yusul techniques. in which a lot of attention was
						paid to the technique of the feet. So, there was a hapkido.<br>


						After the Korean War of 1950-53, the idea of creating a single martial art reflecting
						the spirit of the nation arose in society.
						This idea was implemented by General Choi Hong Hee in <strong> 1955.</strong>  New martial art was based
						on the national Korean martial arts - tekken and subak using elements of karate, which
						Choi Hong Hee studied in Japan.
						The new martial art was called <strong> "Taekwondo".</strong>
						Taekwondo is the pinnacle of the development of Korean martial arts, and all the earlier
						styles are declared to be lower stages of its development.
						Taekwondo is more of a sport than a martial art with spiritual and philosophical roots,
						and therefore is suitable for mass study.<br>

						In <strong> 1966  </strong> Choi Hong Hee moved the headquarters to the International Federation of Taekwondo
						in Canada (Toronto), leaving Seoul. To differ from the South Korean analogue, the name of
						the style began to sound in a western manner - "taekwondo", and the framework of the
						International Federation (ITF) narrowed to the countries of Eastern Europe and North Korea.
						In November 1972, the Kukkivon Taekwondo Development and Promotion Center was opened in Seoul.
						Since 1973, there is the headquarters of the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF), led by Kim Un Yeong.
						It is WTF which has branches in <strong> 118 countries </strong> of the world. From the very beginning, a policy
						was defined - to develop taekwondo as a modern sport for inclusion in the program of the Olympic Games.
						Since its inception, all WTF activities have been subordinated to ensuring that Taekwondo meets
						all the criteria of the Olympic Charter. The first international recognition came on October 8, 1975.
						The International Organization of Sports Federations (GAISF) recognized WTF as an organization
						representing taekwondo in the world.<br>
						In April <strong> 1976, </strong> the Taekwondo WTF was approved as the 23rd official sport by the International
						Council of Army Sports.
						July 17, 1980 at the 83rd General Session of the IOC in Moscow Taekwondo WTF is recognized as a
						pre-Olympic type.
						In January 1981, the WTF was recognized by the International Council for Sports Science and
						Physical Education (ICSSPE).
						In July 1981, Taekwondo participated for the first time in the World Games as an official species.
						In July 1985, approved by the IOC Executive Council as a demonstration at the Olympics in Seoul
						(Korea) in 1988.<br>

						In May <strong> 1986,</strong>  the Executive Committee of the International Federation of University Sports (FISU)
						includes taekwondo in the program of the World Championship among students.
						In September 1991, Taekwondo was included in the program of 3 Goodwill Games as an official sport.
						In August 1992, Taekwondo starts at the Olympics in Barcelona as a demonstration. In September 1994,
						in Paris, at the IOC anniversary session, a unanimous decision was made to include the
						WTF Taekwondo in the official Olympic Games program in Sydney.<br>
						In February <strong> 1995,</strong>  the Taekwondo WTF was recognized by the Association of International Federations
						of Summer Olympic Sports. The first Olympic Taekwondo tournament was held from September 27 to 30,
						2000 in Sydney. One hundred athletes competed for medals in 4 weight categories for men
						(52 participants) and 4 weight categories for women (48 participants). Nowadays, taekwondo
						develops as the main national martial art, Kukkiwon carries out an official assignment of Dan,
						issuing certificates, training instructors, chronicles the success of taekwondo,
						publishes textbooks and produces educational and methodical films. Until the 1980 was created
						4 Taekwondo Unions: The European Taekwondo in May 1976, The Asian Taekwondo in October 1976,
						The Pan American in September 1978, and The African Taekwondo in October 1979, and later in
						July 2005 was created the 5th Union named Oceania Taekwondo.
